# imbACE.Standard

 > The imbACE framework is all about rapid console tool applications development. The project’s goal is to provide completely automated UI/TUI/GUI generation, for multiple platforms – using data annotation and meta information from your IAceAdvancedConsole implementations. The consoles are execution context classes, where the ACE Script Operations (methods, that are interpreted also as ACE Script command) are the main construction blocks. The concept is: you should code only your scientific contribution, wasting no time on the interface and reporting side of the project. This, of course, means, constrained design of the User Interface and/or other outputs. The framework is made for scientists, researchers and technical professionals, that need custom software tools for their specific tools but can’t care less to design and packaging of the tool.
